## Setting up

The first step to integrating with the Volt Time Cloud is to request a client ID and secret. You can do this by contacting us at [volttime.com/contact-us](https://volttime.com/contact-us).

## Costs
As of now the Volt Time Cloud is free to use. We may introduce a pricing model in the future, but we will give you plenty of notice before we do.
