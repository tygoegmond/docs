## Setting up

The first step in integrating with the Volt Time Cloud is to request a client ID and secret for OAuth 2.0 authentication. To obtain these credentials, please contact us at [volttime.com/contact-us](https://volttime.com/contact-us).

Alternatively, if you prefer a more streamlined approach, you can independently [generate a Personal Access Token](/api-reference/authentication#personal-access-tokens) through your profile settings on the Volt Time Cloud. This token allows you to authenticate and access our API without the need for the full OAuth 2.0 authorization process.

## Costs
As of now the Volt Time Cloud is free to use. We may introduce a pricing model in the future, but we will give you plenty of notice before we do.
